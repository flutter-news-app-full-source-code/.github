# Lifetime Commercial License v1.0

This Lifetime Commercial License ("License") is a legal agreement between you ("You" or "Licensee") and the Licensor for the use of The Licensed Source Code.

## 1. Definitions

*   **"The Licensor"** refers to the owner and provider of The Licensed Source Code.
*   **"You"** refers to the individual or legal entity that has acquired this license through a valid purchase.
*   **"The Licensed Source Code"** refers to the entire collection of source code, digital assets, and all other files, in any form, contained within the `flutter-news-app-full-source-code` GitHub organization. This includes the mobile client, the web dashboard, the API server, and all associated packages as a single, indivisible toolkit.
*   **"Single Application"** refers to one distinct software product, identified by a unique Application ID (for Android) and a corresponding Bundle Identifier (for iOS), marketed as a single application.
*   **"The App Stores"** refers to the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

## 2. Acceptance

By purchasing, downloading, or using The Licensed Source Code, you agree to all terms of this License. Your public sponsorship record on GitHub serves as your permanent Proof of Purchase.

## 3. Grant of License

Upon purchase, the Licensor grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to:

a. **Use and Modify:** You may use, copy, and create derivative works of The Licensed Source Code.

b. **Publish and Monetize:** You may publish, distribute, and monetize **one (1) Single Application** on **The App Stores**.

c. **Operate the Toolkit:** This grant explicitly includes the right to deploy and operate the web dashboard and API server components for the sole purpose of supporting the one licensed Single Application.

## 4. License Validation and Enforcement

To validate this license, You must register your Single Application's unique Application ID and Bundle Identifier by emailing them, along with your GitHub username, to the Licensor at `fulleni@hotmail.com`. An application not registered is considered unauthorized. You acknowledge that the Licensor may perform routine checks of The App Stores to identify and report unauthorized use of The Licensed Source Code.

## 5. Key Restrictions

a. **No Redistribution of Source Code.** You may NOT distribute, sell, share, sublicense, or make publicly available The Licensed Source Code, in its original or any modified form. The rights to distribute and monetize apply ONLY to your final, compiled Single Application.

b. **Single Application Limit.** This license is strictly limited to one Single Application. A new, separate license must be purchased for each additional application you wish to create.

c. **Non-Transferable.** This license is granted to you, the purchaser, and is non-transferable. It cannot be sold, assigned, or given to another individual or entity.

## 6. Intellectual Property & Trademarks

a. **Ownership.** The Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the original Licensed Source Code. This License does not grant you ownership, only the rights explicitly stated herein.

b. **Trademarks.** This License does not grant you any right to use the Licensor's names, logos, or trademarks. You must use your own branding for your Single Application.

## 7. Discontinuation of Project

The "lifetime" grant of this license refers to the lifetime of The Licensed Source Code project. The Licensor reserves the right to discontinue development and maintenance at any time, at their sole discretion. In such an event, your license to use the last available version of The Licensed Source Code remains valid, but the Licensor will have no further obligation to provide support or updates.

## 8. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability

THE LICENSED SOURCE CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You acknowledge that The App Stores have their own terms of service and review guidelines that are subject to change. The Licensor does not warrant that The Licensed Source Code will be compliant with these third-party terms now or in the future. You are solely responsible for ensuring your final application complies with all platform rules.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED SOURCE CODE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE LICENSED SOURCE CODE.

## 9. Governing Law

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [YOUR COUNTRY OR STATE], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 10. Termination

Your rights under this License shall terminate immediately and automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.
